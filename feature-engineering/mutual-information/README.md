# Mutual Information

In this exercise:

A function was created to convert all discrete features to integer values.

Seaborn was used to create faceted scatter plots of SalePrice vs selected features.

Mutual Information scores were computed for the Ames dataset and visualized in a horizontal bar chart (top 20 features).

A boxen plot was used to compare the distribution of SalePrice across BldgType categories.

Interaction between GrLivArea and BldgType was analyzed using lmplot, showing different trend lines by category.

In contrast, MoSold showed similar trends across categories, suggesting no interaction.
